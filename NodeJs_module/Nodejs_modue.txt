=>  What is a Module in Node.js?
    Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries. A set of functions you want to include in your application.

***** Built-in Modules *****
Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
EX- 
1.  http - To make Node.js act as an HTTP server.
2.  buffer - To handle binary data.


=>  To include a module we use requires function- 
    var module_name     =   requires('<module_name>');


=>  Create Your Own Modules and use it- 
    1. create a .js file then write some code (function/data variables) that provides data.
    2. now on your node js file include that module (js file)
    3. then use it with the help of created objectof the module.
